# Lab 36: GRC301 Module

**Course:** GRC301 - DevSecOps & Infrastructure as Code  
**Week:** 36  
**Duration:** 5 days  
**Level:** Advanced  
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1-2 completion

## Lab Overview

This lab focuses on integrating GRC into DevSecOps pipelines and implementing Infrastructure as Code security. Participants will build CI/CD pipelines, implement policy-as-code, and automate compliance checks.

## Learning Objectives
