**Phase III: GRC Implementation & Automation (12 weeks)**
- DevSecOps and infrastructure as code
- GRC tooling and platform engineering
- Capstone project

### Can I skip labs or phases?

While you can navigate the repository freely, the curriculum is designed to be progressive. Each phase builds on knowledge from previous phases. We recommend completing labs in sequence for optimal learning outcomes.

### How much time should I dedicate each week?

Each lab is designed to take approximately 4-6 hours to complete, including:
- Reading and understanding instructions
- Completing hands-on tasks
- Documentation and reporting
- Review and submission preparation

Plan for 5-8 hours per week for optimal progress.

## Technical Questions

### What operating system do I need?

The labs are designed for Linux/Unix environments. You can use:
- Native Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended)
- macOS (with some adaptations)
- Windows with WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Virtual machines running Linux

### Do I need cloud accounts (AWS, Azure)?

Some labs reference cloud platforms for learning purposes, but you do not need active cloud accounts for most exercises. Labs use:
- Sample configurations and documentation
- Theoretical scenarios
- Local simulations where possible

Cloud-specific labs provide guidance for free-tier or trial accounts if you choose to use them.

### What programming languages do I need to know?

The programme primarily uses:
- **Bash scripting:** For automation and system tasks
- **Python:** For compliance automation and data analysis

Both are taught progressively throughout the programme. Prior experience is helpful but not required.

### Are the datasets real?

No. All datasets contain fictional data created specifically for educational purposes. Any resemblance to real persons, organizations, or systems is purely coincidental.

## Lab Submission and Assessment

### How are labs graded?

Each lab includes assessment criteria covering:
- Completion of required tasks
- Quality of documentation
- Technical accuracy
- Analysis and insights
- Professional presentation

Detailed rubrics are provided in the assessment documentation.

### What should I submit for each lab?

Each lab submission should include:
1. Lab report (PDF or Markdown) with:
   - Executive summary
   - Objectives and methodology
   - Completed tasks with evidence
   - Findings and analysis
   - Recommendations
2. Supporting files (scripts, configurations, worksheets)
3. Evidence artifacts (screenshots, logs, outputs)

### Can I work with others on labs?

Collaboration on understanding concepts is encouraged. However:
- **Acceptable:** Discussing approaches, seeking clarification, sharing resources
- **Not acceptable:** Copying solutions, sharing completed work, submitting others' work as your own

Review the Code of Conduct and academic integrity guidelines.

### What if I get stuck on a lab?

If you encounter difficulties:
1. Review the lab instructions carefully
2. Check the TROUBLESHOOTING.md guide
3. Search existing GitHub issues
4. Open a GitHub Discussion for help
5. Contact instructors (if formally enrolled)
